We've calculated some individual probabilities, but we can go further with probability. We can calculate and graph *every* probability, and thereby glean further insights into our data. A graph of every probability is called a **Probability Density Function**, and you've probably already seen them and heard of them, since they are popularly called **Bell Curves**.

# Explaining PDFs & CDFs

PDFs help us to make insights about the probability of an entire system. For a better understanding of PDFs, watch one of these primers in PDFs.

Whereas **PDFs** showed the probability of one specific x-value occurring, **CDFs** show the probability of all x-values up to a certain x occurring. In the PDF, the y-axis is the probability of any one x occurring. In the CDF, the y-axis is the percentage of values at or below that x value.

To visualize the relationship between PDFs and CDFs, review [Connecting the CDF and the PDF](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ConnectingTheCDFAndThePDF/) inside the Wolfram Demonstrations Project website.

# From Histogram => PDF

When we graph a PDF, it has a similar pattern to a histogram. The main difference is that instead of the y-axis corresponding to values, it shows the percent probability of the x-axis values. This is known as normalizing the values.

```py
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')
```

First let's look at the age in histogram form:

```py
import seaborn as sns
# create a list of Age values not including N/A values
ls_age = df['Age'].dropna()
# Now plot the data in this list into a histogram!
sns.distplot(ls_age, hist=True, kde=False, bins=16)
```

Now lets look at it with the PDF:

```py
import seaborn as sns
# Notice only the KDE parameter is different!
# What does kde stand for? https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.distplot.html
sns.distplot(df['Age'].dropna(), hist=True, kde=True, bins=16)
```

**Notice that the y-axes are different between the two!** The histogram is the value at an interval of the x-axis, and the PDF y-axis is the probability of being that value.

# Comparing PDF and CDF

Now let's create the CDF of the PDF we just did of the Age feature.

```py
sns.distplot(df['Age'].dropna(), hist_kws=dict(cumulative=True), kde_kws=dict(cumulative=True))
```

From this we can see very clearly the various probabilities. For instance, we can see:

```
Over 85% of the passengers of the Titanic were over 18
```



# Various Known Probability Distributions

If we compare the probability distributions of various systems, statisticians have identified some recurring distributions. We've already seen some of these distributions in the Titanic data. For example, when we graphed the Fare PDF, we saw what is called
