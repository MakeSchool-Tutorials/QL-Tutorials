# Using an Expression of a Line

If you remember your algebra you'll we're going to use the standard algebraic expression for the slope of a line.

```
y = m * x + b
```

But the y and x are going to be replaced with our dependent and independent variables, price and area.

```
price = m * area + b
```

`m` is the slope of our line or the "coefficient", and `b` is the "intercept" or where the line hits the y-axis.


If you want a reminder on this algebraic expression, go ahead and watch this explanation:

# Linear Regression

go through the derivation here, but using calculus we can show that the values of the unknown parameters are as follows:



m is: Cov(area, price) / Var(area).

b = intercept
m1 = coeffficient
